Push-Zeo
========

Push-Zeo pushes the last 14 days' Zeo sleep records (by default) to a dataset on [Singly](http://www.singly.com/).

For it to be useful you'll probably want to run it once a day via `cron`.

Ideally Singly could implement this using [Zeo's notification service](http://mysleep.myzeo.com/api/Zeo_API_Notification_Feature.pdf).
